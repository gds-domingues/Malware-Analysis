# Malware-Analysis
A simple Malware analysis for metadata, hash, traffic analysis

```python
import os
import hashlib
import subprocess
import socket
```

These lines import necessary modules for the script: **`os`** for interacting with the operating system, **`hashlib`** for calculating hash values, **`subprocess`** for executing external commands, and **`socket`** for network-related operations.

```python
Directory where malware samples are stored
MALWARE_SAMPLES_DIR = "malware_samples"
```

Defines the directory path where malware samples are stored. You should replace **`"malware_samples"`** with the actual path where your malware samples are located.

```python
ef get_file_metadata(file_path):
    """
    Get metadata information of the file.
    """
```

Defines a function **`get_file_metadata()`** to retrieve metadata information of a file specified by its path. This function uses the **`os.stat()`** function to get file statistics such as size, creation time, last access time, and last modified time.

```python
def calculate_hash(file_path):
    """
    Calculate hash values (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) of the file.
    """
```

Defines a function **`calculate_hash()`** to calculate hash values (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) of a file specified by its path. This function reads the file content in binary mode and calculates the hash values using the **`hashlib`** module.

```python
def analyze_file(file_path):
    """
    Analyze the file for suspicious characteristics.
    """
```

Defines a function **`analyze_file()`** to analyze a file specified by its path for suspicious characteristics. This function calls **`get_file_metadata()`** and **`calculate_hash()`** to retrieve file metadata and hash values, and then checks for suspicious characteristics based on file extension and other criteria.

```python
def execute_malware(file_path):
    """
    Execute the malware in a sandboxed environment.
    """
```

Defines a function **`execute_malware()`** to execute a malware sample specified by its path in a sandboxed environment. This function attempts to run the malware using an external command (a placeholder command **`sandbox_command`**) with a timeout of 60 seconds.

```python
def capture_network_traffic():
    """
    Capture network traffic using tcpdump.
    """
```

Defines a function **`capture_network_traffic()`** to capture network traffic using **`tcpdump`**. This function runs **`tcpdump`** with specific parameters (**`-i`** for interface and **`-w`** to write output to a file) to capture network traffic and save it to a file named **`"malware_traffic.pcap"`**.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__"
```

Checks if the script is being run as the main program. # Path to the malware sample file malware_sample_path = os.path.join(MALWARE_SAMPLES_DIR, "spotify.exe")

Constructs the full path to the malware sample file (**`spotify.exe`**) by joining the directory path (**`MALWARE_SAMPLES_DIR`**) with the filename.

```python
if os.path.isfile(malware_sample_path):
```

Checks if the malware sample file exists.

```python
# Analyze the malware sample
        metadata, hash_values, suspicious_characteristics = analyze_file(malware_sample_path)
```

Calls the **`analyze_file()`** function to analyze the malware sample and stores the returned metadata, hash values, and suspicious characteristics.

```python
        # Print file metadata
        print("\\nFile Metadata:")
        for key, value in metadata.items():
            print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

Prints the file metadata retrieved from the **`analyze_file()`** function.

```python
        # Print hash values
        print("\\nHash Values:")
        for key, value in hash_values.items():
            print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

Prints the hash values retrieved from the **`analyze_file()`** function.

```python
        # Print suspicious characteristics
        print("\\nSuspicious Characteristics:")
        if suspicious_characteristics:
            for characteristic in suspicious_characteristics:
                print(characteristic)
        else:
            print("No suspicious characteristics found.")
```

Prints the suspicious characteristics retrieved from the **`analyze_file()`** function, if any.

```python
# Execute the malware in a sandboxed environment
        execute_malware(malware_sample_path
```

Calls the **`execute_malware()`** function to execute the malware sample in a sandboxed environment.

```python
 # Capture network traffic generated by the malware
        capture_network_traffic()
```

Calls the **`capture_network_traffic()`** function to capture network traffic generated by the malware sample.

```python
else:
        print("Malware sample not found.")
```

Prints a message if the malware sample file is not found.

This code is designed to analyze a malware sample, print its metadata, hash values, and suspicious characteristics, execute it in a sandboxed environment, and capture network traffic generated by the malware. It's important to exercise caution when working with malware samples, preferably in a controlled environment.
